# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

Thank you for considering contributing to Oxide! It means a lot.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting an issue, make sure the issue has not already been reported.

## Pull Requests

Contributions can be either big or small, all are welcome! Please include as many details as possible in your PR description to help me better understand the contribution. If you are uncertain about some changes, for example if the change might break on some systems, please highlight them so I know what to look out for. Any large scale impacts should ideally be discussed before creating a pull request.

### Keep it minimal

Try to stick to one change per pull request. This will greatly help me review the change. If you find multiple things you want to change, make multiple pull requests. Pull requests that include both refactoring (or reformatting) together with changes are a lot harder to review as every line of change can become a bug and it will be harder for me to find the actual change. Consider splitting refactoring / reformatting changes into separate pull requests for behavioral changes.
